Simple Disk Store
=================

A disk based arbitrary byte arrays key value storage
(Yakvs = yet another key value storage )
Is optimized for fast writes (and as it's append only, it might work pretty well with SSDs).

Currently is just a toy implementation.

Roadmap
-------

Add buffered writes
Moar functional style
Use NIO
spread buckets into directories (will get over the max file name size limit)
Faster byte to hex conversion
Possibly add a bloom filter to the value store, to prevent full file scan if the value is not there
Benchmark with SSD
